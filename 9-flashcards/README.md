This app is a general purpose flashcard app (akin to something like Quizlet). The user can create decks of flashcards, organize them in groups and practice in 2 different modes: practice and test. Note that there is no persistent data storage so created decks will not be remembered after a session.

I created the design for this project in Figma. This project will be using React, Redux (Toolkit), and React-Router along with all the tools and best practices from previous projects.
